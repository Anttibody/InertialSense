# This is the *default* StarTrack configuration that is installed into /etc/StarTrack.yaml, and will be used if NO OTHER CONFIGURATION IS FOUND.
# This uses the "8x11_Landscape" configuration, to be as simple and straight-forward as possible to demonstrate functionality.  It is recommended
# that you use another configuration with more appropriate settings whenever possible.
